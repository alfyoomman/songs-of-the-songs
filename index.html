            <p>
                So I never really knew you<br>
                God, I really tried to<br>
                Blindsided, addicted<br>
                Felt we could really do this<br>
                But really I was foolish<br>
                Hindsight, it's obvious<br>
            </p>
            <p>
               
                <p>                    
                    Talking with my lawyer<br>
                    She said, "Where'd you find this guy?"<br>
                    I said, "Young people fall in love<br>
                    With the wrong people sometimes"<br>
                </p>
                <p class="Rass">    
                    Some mistakes get made<br>
                    That's alright, that's okay<br>
                    You can think that you're in love<br>
                    When you're really just in pain<br>
                    Some mistakes get made<br>
                    That's alright, that's okay<br>
                    In the end, it's better for me<br>
                    That's the moral of the story, babebr><br>
